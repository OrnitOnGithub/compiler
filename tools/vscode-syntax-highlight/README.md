# Kathleen Syntax Highlighting

This is a visual studio code extension for the Kathleen programming language. It supports basic syntax highlighting for .kl files and gives them a nice icon.

## Install manually

You can install this extension through the vscode marketplace, but you can do so manually as well. You need to download the repository for this. https://github.com/OrnitOnGithub/kathleen

To install this way on linux, run `install.sh` from the project's root directory, so you'd run:
```
chmod +x tools/vscode-syntax-highlight/install.sh && ./tools/vscode-syntax-highlight/install.sh
```
