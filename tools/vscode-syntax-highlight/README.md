# Kathleen Syntax Highlighting

This is a visual studio code extension for the Kathleen programming language. It supports basic syntax highlighting for .kl files and gives them a nice icon.

## Install

On linux, run `install.sh` from the project's root directory, so you'd run:
```
chmod +x tools/vscode-syntax-highlight/install.sh && ./tools/vscode-syntax-highlight/install.sh
```
