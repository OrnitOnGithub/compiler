**What is your question?**

For example, I don't understand how the `Token` struct in the tokenizer works, I don't understand how to use this program...

**What part of the documentation or the program is problematic?**

For example, XYZ part of the documentation is incorrect, inaccurate, incomplete, etc...
For example, I don't understand how to do XYZ thing...

**Do you plan on solving this yourself? (if this is a documentation issue)**
For example, yes, I would appreciate solving this issue myself if this github issue gets assigned to me.
