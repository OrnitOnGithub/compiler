This is a temporary TODO that will be replaced later.

- [x] Design an IR

  - [x] Keep track of all existing variables, for both static vs ref and error handling reasons
  - [ ] `let`
    - [x] int
    - [ ] str
  - [ ] `const`
    - [ ] int
    - [x] str
  - [ ] `print` and `println`
    - [x] Print static strings
    - [ ] Print dynamic strings

- [x] Write a proper README
- [ ] Work on document/report thingy
- [x] Make errors look nicer, with colorize crate
- [ ] Add `drop`
- [ ] Add mathematical operators
