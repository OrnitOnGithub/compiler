This is a temporary TODO that will be replaced later.

- [x] Design an IR
- [x] Fix the tokenizer to correctly build strings
  - [ ] ISSUE: if we have a variable called `something`, printing `"something"` would print the variable instead of the string `"something"`.
- [ ] Get `let`, `const` and `print` to compile
  - [x] Keep track of all existing variables, for both static vs ref and error handling reasons
  - [ ] `let`
    - [x] int
    - [ ] str
  - [ ] `const`
    - [ ] int
    - [x] str
  - [ ] `print` and `println`
    - [x] Print static strings
    - [ ] Print dynamic strings
    - [x] Print integers
    - [ ] Print strings defined inside the print itself, like `print("Hello World!")`
    - [x] Fix printing too many newlines issue
- [x] Write a proper README
- [x] Make errors look nicer, with colorize crate
- [ ] Add something like token.is_string in the Token struct.
- [ ] Clean up the IR generator. Seriously.
- [ ] Add `drop`
- [ ] Add mathematical operators
- [ ] Add `fn` and `return`
- [ ] Add `bool`s
- [ ] Add `if` and `else` if I'm feeling generous
- [ ] Add `loop` and `break`
- [ ] Make release / package?
