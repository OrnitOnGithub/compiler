# Ornit's Compiler

This is the second iteration of my compiler. The first iteration was actually an interpret, whatever.

For more info check `non-code` directory. That's where the docs and everything else are.

## The Goal

The goal is to build a compiler that can turn a custom language into an assembly output.
