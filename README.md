# Ornit's Compiler

This is a small compiler that is in the works. The goal of this project is to make a relatively simple piece of code that generates an assembly output for x64 linux netwide assembler.

# Try it

The compiler is not functional yet

# Contribute

As of now I want to work on this by myself. Once the language will have taken its basic shape I will accept contributions.
