How exactly will this work?

final goal:

- one to one instructions to assembly

These instructions must:

- Handle memory properly
    - Handle pointers

    
## De-abstractisation of the code

### Idea #1:

- Data structure (already implemented)
- One to one instructions

### Idea #2

- More linear data
- Turn linear data into less abstracted one to one instructions

### Idea #3

- Bytecode
- Every code turns into one pre-programmed instruction
- Kinda like java

### Idea #4
